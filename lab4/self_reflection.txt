All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I implemented by myself without any hint from others.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I thought I can not keep the code consistent. In other words, I do not use the simple code to implement every case.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: 

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: The actual meaning of ArrayDeque. I do not know why we have to implement two end Array after implementing proj1b.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Rewrite a better `resize` method

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: It cost me less time to implement all of method in LinkedListDeque

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I thought there was always better way to simplify trivial code.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: Like the same answer to ArrayDeque, I would like to know the application rather than implementation.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I think I can write more efficient.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I thought it is good for a programmer to review the process.
